project using TypeORM.\nPrerequisites\n\nEnsure pnpm is installed globally.\nEnsure TypeORM and ts-node are installed as dependencies in the project.\nEnsure you have a .env file properly set up for database connections.\n\nUsage\nThe general syntax for the migration command:\nExample :pnpm migration -m  -c  [-a ]Parameters:\n\n-m, --microservice → Specifies the target microservice (e.g., auth, escrow, user, etc.).\n-c, --command → Specifies the TypeORM migration command to run (e.g., generate, run, revert, seed, etc.).\n-t, --title (optional) → Title for migration file. Needed while running generate.\n-a, --args (optional) → Additional arguments passed to TypeORM CLI.\n\n\nAvailable Commands\n1. Generate a Migration\nCreates a new migration file based on changes in entity definitions.\nExample :pnpm migration -m organization -c generate -t CreateOrganization\n-m organization → Runs migration for the organization microservice.\n-c generate → Generates a migration file.\n-t \"CreateOrganization\" → Specifies the migration file name.\n\n\n2. Run Migrations\nApplies pending migrations to the database.\nExample :pnpm migration -m escrow -c run\n-m escrow → Runs migrations for the escrow microservice.\n-c run → Executes pending migrations.\n\n\n3. Revert Last Migration\nRolls back the most recent migration.\nExample :pnpm migration -m user -c revert\n-m user → Targets the user microservice.\n-c revert → Rolls back the latest migration.\n\n\n4. Show Migration Status\nLists applied and pending migrations.\nExample :pnpm migration -m property -c show\n-m property → Targets the property microservice.\n-c show → Displays migration history.\n\n\n5. Run Seeder\nExecutes the seed script for a microservice.\nExample :pnpm migration -m user -c seed\n-m user → Targets the user microservice.\n-c seed → Runs the seeder script located at apps/user/src/seeder/seeder.ts.\n\n\nNotes\n\nThe -m flag is mandatory to specify which microservice's migration should be executed.\nThe CLI automatically resolves the correct TypeORM DataSource file based on the microservice name.\nIf no changes are detected when generating a migration, the CLI will not throw an error but will log a warning instead.\nIf -c seed is used, the CLI will execute the corresponding seeder.ts file for the specified microservice.\n\nTroubleshooting\nError: \"No changes in database schema were found\"\n\nEnsure that your entities are properly configured and registered in the microservice's DataSource.\nVerify that the database is up to date with the latest migrations.\n\nError: \"Cannot find module 'typeorm'\"\n\nRun pnpm install to ensure dependencies are correctly installed.\n\n\nFuture Enhancements\n\nAutomate versioning with Release Please integration.\nSupport interactive mode for selecting microservices and commands.\nEnhance error handling and logging.\n\n\nThis CLI provides an efficient way to manage database migrations across multiple microservices in a monorepo setup.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/running-migrations-and-seeders/how-to-use-migration-tool.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/running-migrations-and-seeders/how-to-use-migration-tool.html","title":"additional-page - How to use migration tool","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration CLI Manual\nThis CLI is designed to streamline database migration management in a multi-microservice NestJS project using TypeORM.\nPrerequisites\n\nEnsure pnpm is installed globally.\nEnsure TypeORM and ts-node are installed as dependencies in the project.\nEnsure you have a .env file properly set up for database connections.\n\nUsage\nThe general syntax for the migration command:\nExample :pnpm migration -m  -c  [-a ]Parameters:\n\n-m, --microservice → Specifies the target microservice (e.g., auth, escrow, user, etc.).\n-c, --command → Specifies the TypeORM migration command to run (e.g., generate, run, revert, seed, etc.).\n-t, --title (optional) → Title for migration file.
