Authorization)\n\nSecurity: Ensuring the system is secure from unauthorized access. This includes strong password policies, token-based authentication (e.g., JWT), and OAuth if required.\nToken Expiry and Refresh: Managing token expiration and refresh mechanisms. Implement token blacklisting for security.\nRate Limiting: Protecting against brute-force attacks by implementing rate limiting or CAPTCHA.\nSecure API Communication: Ensuring all communication (especially authentication data) is encrypted with HTTPS.\nUser Roles and Permissions: Managing user roles and ensuring each user (tenant, landlord, admin) has the correct permissions for their actions.\n\n2. user (User Management)\n\nUser Data Management: Ensuring that personal data is secure, especially sensitive information like emails, addresses, and phone numbers.\nData Privacy: Complying with regulations like GDPR or CCPA, especially regarding the collection and storage of user data.\nUser Profile Updates: Allowing users to update their profiles (e.g., changing names, contact details) while maintaining data integrity.\nError Handling: Handling errors effectively, such as invalid user data, and providing clear feedback to users.\nScalability: Ensuring the system can handle large numbers of users (tenants, landlords).\n\n3. property (Property Management)\n\nProperty Data Validation: Ensuring that property details are accurate, complete, and properly validated before being listed.\nSearch Functionality: Providing a fast and efficient way for tenants to search for properties (by location, price, features, etc.).\nProperty Availability: Managing the availability of properties and preventing double-booking or issues with properties already rented.\nImage and Media Handling: Handling and storing images, videos, and 3D scans securely and efficiently. Integrating with media service when required.\nData Consistency: Ensuring that any updates to the property data (e.g., status changes, price updates) are consistent and reflected across all services.\n\n4. escrow (Escrow Service)\n\nDeposit Security: Ensuring that the deposit is secure, especially when handling large amounts of money.\nTransaction Auditing: Providing an auditable trail of deposit and release actions for transparency and security.\nEscrow Release Conditions: Implementing clear rules on when the deposit should be released to either the tenant or landlord.\nDispute Management: Handling any disputes regarding the deposit, such as property damage or failure to pay rent.\nCompliance: Ensuring that escrow services comply with local financial and regulatory standards (especially for handling money).\nEvent-Driven Updates: Integrating with other services (e.g., notifying users about escrow releases or disputes) using event-driven architecture.\n\n5. organization (Organization Management)\n\nMulti-Tenant Support: Managing organizations and their members, ensuring proper isolation between different organizations.\nAccess Control: Implementing role-based access control within organizations.\nBilling and Subscriptions: Managing organization-level billing and payments.\nOrganization Verification: Ensuring that organizations are verified before allowing transactions.\n\n6. payment (Payment Service)\n\nPayment Gateway Integration: Integrating with external payment providers (e.g., UPI, Paytm, Razorpay) for processing payments.\nTransaction Security: Ensuring secure handling of payments and sensitive financial data. Use of encryption and secure protocols.\nTransaction Failures: Handling payment failures and retries in case of network or gateway issues.\nPayment Confirmation: Sending clear confirmation of successful payments and generating receipts.\nRecurring Payments: Supporting recurring rent payments (e.g., monthly payments) and ensuring they are processed on time.\n\n7. notification (Notification Service)\n\nNotification Delivery: Ensuring timely delivery of notifications (SMS, email, push notifications) to users.\nOpt-in/Opt-out Preferences: Allowing users to manage their notification preferences.\n\n8. gateway (API Gateway)\n\nRequest Routing: Efficiently routing requests to the appropriate microservice based on the endpoint and service.\nSecurity: Ensuring that requests passing through the gateway are authenticated and authorized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results

project using TypeORM.\nPrerequisites\n\nEnsure pnpm is installed globally.\nEnsure TypeORM and ts-node are installed as dependencies in the project.\nEnsure you have a .env file properly set up for database connections.\n\nUsage\nThe general syntax for the migration command:\nExample :pnpm migration -m  -c  [-a ]Parameters:\n\n-m, --microservice → Specifies the target microservice (e.g., auth, escrow, user, etc.).\n-c, --command → Specifies the TypeORM migration command to run (e.g., generate, run, revert, seed, etc.).\n-t, --title (optional) → Title for migration file. Needed while running generate.\n-a, --args (optional) → Additional arguments passed to TypeORM CLI.\n\n\nAvailable Commands\n1. Generate a Migration\nCreates a new migration file based on changes in entity definitions.\nExample :pnpm migration -m organization -c generate -t CreateOrganization\n-m organization → Runs migration for the organization microservice.\n-c generate → Generates a migration file.\n-t \"CreateOrganization\" → Specifies the migration file name.\n\n\n2. Run Migrations\nApplies pending migrations to the database.\nExample :pnpm migration -m escrow -c run\n-m escrow → Runs migrations for the escrow microservice.\n-c run → Executes pending migrations.\n\n\n3. Revert Last Migration\nRolls back the most recent migration.\nExample :pnpm migration -m user -c revert\n-m user → Targets the user microservice.\n-c revert → Rolls back the latest migration.\n\n\n4. Show Migration Status\nLists applied and pending migrations.\nExample :pnpm migration -m property -c show\n-m property → Targets the property microservice.\n-c show → Displays migration history.\n\n\n5. Run Seeder\nExecutes the seed script for a microservice.\nExample :pnpm migration -m user -c seed\n-m user → Targets the user microservice.\n-c seed → Runs the seeder script located at apps//src/seeder/seeder.ts.\n\n\nNotes\n\nThe -m flag is mandatory to specify which microservice's migration should be executed.\nThe CLI automatically resolves the correct TypeORM DataSource file based on the microservice name.\nIf no changes are detected when generating a migration, the CLI will not throw an error but will log a warning\ninstead.\nIf -c seed is used, the CLI will execute the corresponding seeder.ts file for the specified microservice. Seeders\nare used to populate the database with initial data and should be located at\napps//src/seeder/seeder.ts.\n\nTroubleshooting\nError: \"No changes in database schema were found\"\n\nEnsure that your entities are properly configured and registered in the microservice's DataSource.\nVerify that the database is up to date with the latest migrations.\n\nError: \"Cannot find module 'typeorm'\"\n\nRun pnpm install to ensure dependencies are correctly installed.\n\n\nFuture Enhancements\n\nAutomate versioning with Release Please integration.\nSupport interactive mode for selecting microservices and commands.\nEnhance error handling and logging.\n\n\nThis CLI provides an efficient way to manage database migrations across multiple microservices in a monorepo setup.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/running-migrations-and-seeders/how-to-use-migration-tool.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/running-migrations-and-seeders/how-to-use-migration-tool.html","title":"additional-page - How to use migration tool","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration CLI Manual\nThis CLI is designed to streamline database migration management in a multi-microservice NestJS project using TypeORM.\nPrerequisites\n\nEnsure pnpm is installed globally.\nEnsure TypeORM and ts-node are installed as dependencies in the project.\nEnsure you have a .env file properly set up for database connections.\n\nUsage\nThe general syntax for the migration command:\nExample :pnpm migration -m  -c  [-a ]Parameters:\n\n-m, --microservice → Specifies the target microservice (e.g., auth, escrow, user, etc.).\n-c, --command → Specifies the TypeORM migration command to run (e.g., generate, run, revert, seed, etc.).\n-t, --title (optional) → Title for migration file.
