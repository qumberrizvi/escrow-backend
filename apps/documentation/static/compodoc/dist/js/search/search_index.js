Authorization)\n\nSecurity: Ensuring the system is secure from unauthorized access. This includes strong password policies, token-based authentication (e.g., JWT), and OAuth if required.\nToken Expiry and Refresh: Managing token expiration and refresh mechanisms. Implement token blacklisting for security.\nRate Limiting: Protecting against brute-force attacks by implementing rate limiting or CAPTCHA.\nSecure API Communication: Ensuring all communication (especially authentication data) is encrypted with HTTPS.\nUser Roles and Permissions: Managing user roles and ensuring each user (tenant, landlord, admin) has the correct permissions for their actions.\n\n2. qushah-user (User Management)\n\nUser Data Management: Ensuring that personal data is secure, especially sensitive information like emails, addresses, and phone numbers.\nData Privacy: Complying with regulations like GDPR or CCPA, especially regarding the collection and storage of user data.\nUser Profile Updates: Allowing users to update their profiles (e.g., changing names, contact details) while maintaining data integrity.\nError Handling: Handling errors effectively, such as invalid user data, and providing clear feedback to users.\nScalability: Ensuring the system can handle large numbers of users (tenants, landlords).\n\n3. qushah-property (Property Management)\n\nProperty Data Validation: Ensuring that property details are accurate, complete, and properly validated before being listed.\nSearch Functionality: Providing a fast and efficient way for tenants to search for properties (by location, price, features, etc.).\nProperty Availability: Managing the availability of properties and preventing double-booking or issues with properties already rented.\nImage and Media Handling: Handling and storing images, videos, and 3D scans securely and efficiently. Integrating with media service when required.\nData Consistency: Ensuring that any updates to the property data (e.g., status changes, price updates) are consistent and reflected across all services.\n\n4. qushah-escrow (Escrow Service)\n\nDeposit Security: Ensuring that the deposit is secure, especially when handling large amounts of money.\nTransaction Auditing: Providing an auditable trail of deposit and release actions for transparency and security.\nEscrow Release Conditions: Implementing clear rules on when the deposit should be released to either the tenant or landlord.\nDispute Management: Handling any disputes regarding the deposit, such as property damage or failure to pay rent.\nCompliance: Ensuring that escrow services comply with local financial and regulatory standards (especially for handling money).\nEvent-Driven Updates: Integrating with other services (e.g., notifying users about escrow releases or disputes) using event-driven architecture.\n\n5. qushah-payment (Payment Service)\n\nPayment Gateway Integration: Integrating with external payment providers (e.g., UPI, Paytm, Razorpay) for processing payments.\nTransaction Security: Ensuring secure handling of payments and sensitive financial data. Use of encryption and secure protocols.\nTransaction Failures: Handling payment failures and retries in case of network or gateway issues.\nPayment Confirmation: Sending clear confirmation of successful payments and generating receipts.\nRecurring Payments: Supporting recurring rent payments (e.g., monthly payments) and ensuring they are processed on time.\nMulti-currency Support: Initially handling INR and later possibly adding other currencies, without complicating the architecture.\nScalability: Ensuring the service can handle large volumes of transactions, especially for a growing user base.\n\n6. qushah-notification (Notification Service)\n\nNotification Delivery: Ensuring timely delivery of notifications (SMS, email, push notifications) to users.\nMessage Templates: Using dynamic templates for notifications (e.g., rent payment reminders, property status updates).\nMulti-channel Support: Ensuring support for multiple communication channels (SMS, email, mobile push notifications, etc.).\nHandling Failures: Managing failed notification deliveries and retries, e.g., if an email service is down.\nPersonalization: Allowing notifications to be personalized based on user preferences (e.g., notification frequency, type of notifications).\nOpt-in/Opt-out Preferences: Allowing users to manage their notification preferences (e.g., unsubscribing from specific types of notifications).\n\n7. qushah-media (Media Handling)\n\nStorage: Securely storing large media files (images, videos, 3D scans) and ensuring they are easily accessible.\nPerformance: Ensuring that media uploads and downloads are fast and efficient, especially for large files.\nScalability: Managing storage at scale as media files (especially 3D scans) can consume significant space.\nCompression and Optimization: Automatically compressing and optimizing media files for faster loading times and reduced storage usage.\nSecurity: Protecting media files from unauthorized access and ensuring that the uploaded files are virus-free.\nIntegration: Providing an easy API for other microservices to use (e.g., for uploading profile pictures, property images, etc.).\n\n8. qushah-gateway (API Gateway)\n\nRequest Routing: Efficiently routing requests to the appropriate microservice based on the endpoint and service.\nSecurity: Ensuring that requests passing through the gateway are authenticated and authorized.\nLoad Balancing: Ensuring requests are distributed evenly across multiple instances of each microservice for scalability.\nRate Limiting: Preventing abuse of the system by applying rate limits on specific endpoints.\nAPI Documentation: Providing clear API documentation (e.g., using Swagger or GraphQL introspection) for the frontend and third-party developers.\nCaching: Implementing caching for high-traffic endpoints to improve performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n
